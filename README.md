# Abstract

For a very long time, I'm writing multi-lingual package documentations, e.g.,
for some of the deprecated packages, that have been removed from
[KOMA-Script](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/koma-script) or packages like
[`scrlayer-fancyhdr`](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/scrlayer-fancyhdr). In the
past, I've added code for handling of labels in different languages again and
again to the documentation of these packages or to the classes used for these
documentations. End of 2023 I've decided to write a somehow more general
package for this.

# State of Work

Currently this is a very early version of the package, not really more than an
experiment. There is no guaranty for any functionality even not for the
already documented LaTeX3 functions or LaTeX2ε user commands.

# Installation

Currently there package has not been released on CTAN. So it is also not part
of any (La)TeX distribution. The easiest installation process is to clone the
github repository or to download a source archive an unpack it. Afterwards you
can use

    l3build install --full

to do a local installation of the package and the documentation.

# How to Contribute

Because this is more or less an internal package only, contribution is not
really needed.

# How to Report Issues

Because this is more or less an internal package only, reporting issues will
not really influence the development. However, if you want, you can use the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/komascript/locallabel/issues) to report
issues. But please, don't expect any response or other reactions.

# How to Say Thank You for my Work

Hey, I'm doing this as a hobby. So no need to say thank you. But I'm a vain
fop, so I'm certainly up for a quick thank you by email. On komascript.de you
can find an [explanation of my wishes](https://komascript.de/wunschliste) if
you want to give more. If you don't understand German, just click to links at
that page. ;-)
